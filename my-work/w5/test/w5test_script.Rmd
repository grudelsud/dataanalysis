anova with multiple factors

```{r}
movies <- read.csv('../data/movies.txt', sep="\t")
head(movies)
```

now do some shit, start with anova models

```{r}
aovObj <- aov(movies$score ~ movies$rating + movies$genre)
summary(aovObj)

aovObj2 <- aov(movies$score ~ movies$genre + movies$rating)
summary(aovObj2)
```

order matters for unordered design! because we are evaluating percentage of variation taking into account something else

## binary outcomes

```{r}
download.file("https://dl.dropbox.com/u/7710864/data/ravensData.rda", destfile="../data/ravensData.rda",method="curl")
load("../data/ravensData.rda")
head(ravensData)

ravenLm <- lm(ravensData$ravenWinNum ~ ravensData$ravenScore)
summary(ravenLm)
```

observing weird data here: intercept of 0.28 would mean that ravens have a probability of 28% winning the game if they score 0 points.

let's plot the score / prob win of the fitted model

```{r}
plot(ravensData$ravenScore, ravenLm$fitted, cex=0.7, pch=20, col="#ff9900", ylab="prob ravens win")
```

there are probs > 1, since the variable score is treated as continous while it's discrete. so we can use a logistic regression defining the binomial distribution of the score

```{r}
ravenGLm <- glm(ravensData$ravenWinNum ~ ravensData$ravenScore, family="binomial")
summary(ravenGLm)
plot(ravensData$ravenScore, ravenGLm$fitted, cex=0.7, pch=20, col="#22cc00", ylab="prob ravens win")
```

now explore the results and try to explain them

```{r}
# these are log coeffs, score > 0 means it's more likely to win
ravenGLm$coeff

# eval exp if linear coeffs are needed, score > 1 means it's more likely to win
exp(ravenGLm$coeff)
exp(confint(ravenGLm))
# anova with a little bit of magic, adding test="Chisq" returns the p value
anova(ravenGLm, test="Chisq")
```
